# Overview

I created this Dynamic BMI Calculator using Python as a web app and deployed on Streamlit. This calculator allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by simply entering their height and weight. The BMI is a swift and easy way to assess balance of the weight of a particular body with it's height.
